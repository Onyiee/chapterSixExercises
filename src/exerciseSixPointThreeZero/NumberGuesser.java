//6.30 (Guess the Number) Write an application that plays “guess the number” as follows: Your
//        program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000.
//        The application displays the prompt Guess a number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs a first
//        guess. If the player's guess is incorrect, your program should display Too high. Try again. or
//        Too
//        low. Try again. to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer. The program should prompt
//        the
//        user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display Congratulations. You
//        guessed the number!, and allow the user to choose whether to play again. [Note: The guessing
//        technique employed in this problem is similar to a binary search, which is discussed in
//        Chapter 19,
//        Searching, Sorting and Big O.]
